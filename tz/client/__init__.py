"""
    The TransitionZero platform gives users the ability to explore historic energy
    data, and to ask research questions about the energy future,
    using TransitionZero's 'batteries-included' systems modelling platform.
    This package, `tz-client`, allows users to interact with the platform via
    both a low-level api wrapper, and a set of higher-order class objects.

    To import the tz client library:
    ```python
    from tz import client
    ```

    Authenticate via the command line with
    ```
    tz auth login
    ```

    To use the lower-level api wrapper:
    ```python
    from tz.client import api
    ```

    To use the high-level objects:
    ```python
    from tz.client import Node, Model, ModelScenario
    ```
