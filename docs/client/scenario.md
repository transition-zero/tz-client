# Scenario

All FEO models employ scenario analysis to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economic conditions at play. Scenarios are designed to be used as a set to explore and navigate what might happen, not what should happen or what we want to happen.

For example, in the Indonesia JETP model currently available in FEO, we have four scenarios:

- Coal Phaseout
- Current Policies
- Least Cost
- NetZero 2060

To access data for these scenarios, you can use this [Jupyter Notebook on Github](https://github.com/transition-zero/feo-client-examples/blob/main/feo-client-examples/3_system_model_results.ipynb).
